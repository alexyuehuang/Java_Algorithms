Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1: loop: k<n+m if A[i]<B[j], C[k]=A[i]; i++,k++, else C[k]=B[j]....

Question A2: 

Question A3: i+j++ each turn, terminate after i+j=m+n-1

Question A4: i+j from 0 to n+m-1, each time add 1, i+j=k, each time either +i+k, or +j+k

Question A5: loop invariant: contains every element in both arrays; progress condition: sorted

Question B1: theta(n)

Question B2: T(n)=2T(n/2)+cn

Question B3: T(n)=theta(nlogn), use master method

Question B4: T(n)=kT(n/k)+cn

Question B5: It doesn't impact.

Question C1: theta(nlogn)

Question C2: Yes. Each time after we get C, we replace A and B with new things, since they are useless

Question C3: It uses far less extra space when n is very large

Question C4: heapify n times, from the last element to the top. 

Question C5: each time extract the next element, putting it to the last one of the heap while maintaining the heap property of
the part of the heap, each time heapify the rest of the heap.

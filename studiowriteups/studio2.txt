Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1: n^2

Question A2: Adding the nth term to the list will involve searching through the list, which has a complexity of Theta(n);

Question B1:linear

Question B2:1, the pointer

Question B3:It is mostly worthwhile. The exception is that we have a tight storage space.

Question C1:3n+3

Question C2:adding another instance variable to store the length, using storage

Question C3:it only needs 1 statement. No, because the addLast is already Theta(n)

Question D1:Theta(n)

Question D2:a pointer to the midpoint. very similar to the last problem, only that it changes every two addings. Don't change

Question D3:Basically the same, design an instance variable that stores the max value. Every time we add an element we compare
it to the biggest.

Question D4:More complex, but still Theta(n), because if we have deleted the biggest element we have to search over.

Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question PS1: 
Both lines rise more steeply over time, showing a parabola. The time charts are slightly distorted, because 
other programs might be running at the same time, using computer capacity. 

Question PS2:
The first plot was a line, and the second is a parabola.
	
Question PS3: 
The plot is generally the same, remaining in the parabola shape, although the time of each trial is different.
	
Question PS4: 
y=nx^2, n is a real number.
		
Question PS5: 
If remove all, the tick count would be the same as linear. Otherwise, it would be parabola. 
	
Question A1:
The curve is flat, meaning that n has no influence on ticks. 
	
Question A2:
No, the time indicates that the time is not constant.
	
Question A3:
No, because each run has a constant tick, but not constant time. 
	
Question A4:
More similar, so it takes linear time. It is looping through the entire array.

Question A5:
Decimal: log10(n); mark: n. Mark is always slower(or equally). 

Question A6:
log2(n)+1, 5

Question A7:
Either vs unary.
	
Question C1:
A parabola. kx^2

Question C2:
Reflect the times the array grows twice.

Question C3:
This one. y=5.5x
	
Question D1:
x(x+1)/2, yes
	
Question D2:
2n-1, yes

Question A2: x_1=x_2 and y_1=y_2

Question A3: 31x+17y

Question A4: No, for example, (0,0) and (17,-31)map to same hashcode of 0

Question A5: x+y, no, because it is too easy for two distinct points to have the same hashcode

Question B1: 32

Question B2: Yes, because the maximum hashcode possible is smaller than 2^8*2^24=2^32. No 

Question B3: Yes, approximately, about 50

Question B4: not a lot of derivation, basically random

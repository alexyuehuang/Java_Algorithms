Question A13: not solvable

Question A14: not solvable

Question A15: theta(n^2)

Question B1: what if middle element is the value we want

Question B2: everytime if the asked value is smaller than the middle point it must be on the left of it to satisfy ordered property

Question B3: last biggest, infinie loop

Question B4: not correct because the integer division gets to grounds

Question B5: each time get precisely half

Question B6: make sure that don't get into loop

Question B7: 

Question C1: no. always right

Question C2: leftmost

Question C3: if the founded element is in midpoint, we abandon its right

Question C4: change midpoint formula, then include midpoint in the right.

Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1: E0 FG1 BD2 AC3

Question A2: E to FG, F to B, G to D, D to AC, B to c

Question A3: E8 13, F9 10, G11 12, B1 6, D4 5, A0 7, C2 3

Question B1: No, have cycles

Question B2: If v finishes earlier than u, u comes before v in ordering, then u->v

Question B3: Then we go to v, start v, and after some steps, end v. Because acyclic we cannot reach u in the process,
therefore v finishes first.

Question B4: Since we're looking in (u,v), u is by far not finished, by v is already finished, so v finishes first

Question B5: No, because the map is acyclic

Question B6: For all the possibilities of v, v finishes earlier than u, which proves our thing. 

Question C1: ACDBEF

Question C2: ABECDF, ACBDEF, ABCEDF

Question C3: search from the last element and goes to the first

Question C4: vn

Question C5: First finish

Question C6: The element in X is the Xth earliest to finish

Question C7: Start from F, then goes to E or start from E

Question D1: If exist (vi,vi+1), we cannot put vi+1 before vi; if the edge does not exist, and we also know that we 
cannot do (vi+1, vi), then the ordering of the two does not matter

Question D2: Because has unique order, every vi, vi+1 is directly connected, so we can chain them up

Question D3: Calculate the topographical order, then check for path between any two |V|+|E|

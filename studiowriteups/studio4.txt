Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1: T(n)=2T(n-1)+2

Question A2: 2^n

Question A3: Let T(n)=theta(2^n), then T(n+1)=theta(2^(n+1))

Question B1: theta(lgn n)

Question B2: theta(n^2)

Question B3: theta(n^3)

Question C1: theta(lgn)

Question C2: As long as the base case is still constant, it doesn't change. Changing T(1) from 1 to m will get us (m-1)n
more runs, which will not affect anything

Question C3: No, because we will increase Tn/n by 1, which doesn't affect anything

Question C4: No, because we will get n+the original value, so the asymptotic behavior doesn't change

Question C5: Because they doesn't affect the asymptotic running time.
